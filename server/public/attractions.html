                <h1>Ghibli Museum</h1>
            </a>
                <p> Experience the maze-like building, the fun of animation and discover the many 
                    fascinating and beautiful treasures created by Studio Ghibli. The Ghibli Museum is 
                    dedicated to the studio’s work, as well as to illuminating the mechanics of the 
                    world of animation. Even though there are many references to the lovable films within 
                    the museum, you don’t have to be a Studio Ghibli fan to appreciate the amazing artistry 
                    on display, or be completely charmed by the exhibits!

                    Located on the edge of Tokyo’s Inokashira Park, the Ghibli Museum is a multi-storied mansion 
                    full of twists and turns, tiny doors, winding staircases, and a rooftop garden — 
                    recreating the mood of the enchanting Studio Ghibli universe.</p>
