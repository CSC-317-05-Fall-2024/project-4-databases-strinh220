        <p> Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is located in the Pacific Ocean 
            off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, and is bordered on the west 
            by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the 
            East China Sea in the south. </p>
        <p> This is a picture of Shinjuku (新宿). Shinjuku is one of the 23 city wards of Tokyo,
            but the name commonly refers to just the large entertainment, business and shopping
            area around Shinjuku Station. </p>
